**Project 1: Exploring the Transition to Clean Fuel Technology in BRICS Nations**

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this interactive storyboard is to visually explore the transition to clean fuel technology in the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). By analyzing data on access to clean fuel technology over time and its impact, viewers can gain insights into the progress made by these countries and the challenges that remain.

Design choices:
- Color is used to encode different countries in the unique design visualization, allowing viewers to easily distinguish between them.
- The filtered visualizations for different BRICS nations that are arranged side by side to facilitate comparison and analysis of the data.
- Time sliders are included in the filtered visualizations to enable users to focus on specific time periods and observe trends over time.
- Simple and intuitive interactions, such as selecting time periods and hovering over data points for additional information, enhance the user experience and facilitate exploration of the data.
